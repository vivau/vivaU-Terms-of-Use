1. Introduction

Welcome! By reading this, you are 
considering joining a movement, not a mere 
platform. VivaU is a secure, encrypted, 
ephemeral environment where communities can 
organize, share resources, and communicate 
without fear of surveillance or 
interference.
This prospectus explains, in detail, what 
volunteering entails, how the platform 
functions, and the principles guiding every 
line of code. Our goal is complete clarity, 
transparency, and alignment with the safety 
and privacy of the communities we serve.
Volunteering with VivaU is about directly 
protecting and empowering people under 
threat. You are not just helping a project.
You are helping ensure that organizers, 
activists, journalists, and vulnerable 
communities have a shield against 
oppression.



2. Why VivaU Exists

VivaU exists because the world has become 
unsafe:
	•	Governments, corporations, and 
malicious actors constantly monitor 
communication channels.
	•	Activists, community organizers, 
journalists, and marginalized communities 
are targeted for their work or beliefs.
	•	Conventional platforms track, store,
and monetize user data, making users 
vulnerable to exploitation, harassment, or 
legal consequences.

VivaU’s purpose:
	1.	Protect lives and freedom — create a 
platform where users can communicate, 
organize, and request or offer mutual aid 
without risk of surveillance or profiling.
	2.	Guarantee privacy — no backdoors, 
no analytics, no corporate partnerships, 
no tracking.
	3.	Empower communities — provide tools 
for mutual aid, organizing, and safe 
connection.

This is a purpose-driven project. We are 
coding from scratch because no existing 
platform meets our uncompromising standards 
for end-to-end encryption, ephemeral 
storage, and user-controlled data.



3. Platform Overview

VivaU is being built with security-first 
principles. At launch, the platform will 
focus on critical core functionality:

Core Features
	1.	Community Feed
	•	Users can post updates, announcements,
and news.
	•	Posts are ephemeral: they exist until 
the user deletes them.
	•	Only participants see the posts; data 
is never permanently stored.
	2.	Mutual Aid Pages / Forms
	•	Users can request help or offer 
resources safely.
	•	Forms are submitted securely; only 
authorized participants see them.
	•	All submissions are encrypted and 
ephemeral.
	3.	Direct Messages (DMs)
	•	Fully end-to-end encrypted by default.
	•	Messages are never stored permanently;
deletion removes content from all clients.
	•	Only sender and recipient can read 
messages; not VivaU, not the provider, not 
any government entity.

Future Features (After Core Safety is 
Established)
	•	Livestreaming and real-time event 
coordination
	•	Profile customization and social 
features
	•	Additional collaboration tools

Technical Principles
	•	End-to-End Encryption: Every message, 
post, and form is encrypted on the client 
side.
	•	Ephemeral Storage: Nothing is 
permanently written; deleted content is 
irreversibly purged.
	•	Metadata Stripping: All uploaded media 
is stripped of GPS, EXIF, and device data.
	•	IP Masking: IP addresses are never 
stored raw and are obfuscated to prevent 
tracking.
	•	No Third-Party Dependencies: No 
trackers, ads, analytics, or data-sharing.



4. Volunteer Roles & Responsibilities

Volunteers are the backbone of VivaU. 
Your role is to support platform 
functionality, testing, and safe use, 
while upholding security standards.

Primary Roles
	1.	Mutual Aid Support
	•	Review submitted forms for clarity and 
safety compliance.
	•	Help organize requests/offers in ways 
that maximize usefulness without exposing 
sensitive data.
	•	Provide feedback to ensure the 
interface is intuitive and secure.
   2.	Testing & Quality Assurance
	•	Test all features, including posts, 
DMs, and forms.
	•	Identify bugs, usability issues, or 
potential privacy risks.
	•	Confirm that deleted content is fully 
removed and cannot be reconstructed.
	3.	Community Feedback
	•	Gather input from early users on 
usability, clarity, and safety.
	•	Provide detailed reports on areas for 
improvement.
	•	Suggest features only after verifying 
they maintain privacy-first principles.
	4.	Documentation & Training
	•	Assist in creating guides for users 
and volunteers.
	•	Draft security instructions, FAQs, and 
protocols for safe operation.



Technical Volunteers / Coders & Developers

Coders and developers are critical for 
building and maintaining VivaU. Your work 
ensures the platform meets the highest 
standards of security, privacy, and 
functionality.

Responsibilities:
	•	Frontend Development
	•	Translate Figma designs into fully 
functional React components without 
altering visual design.
	•	Ensure proper integration of community 
feed, mutual aid forms, and DMs.
	•	Implement secure handling of encrypted 
messages and ephemeral data in the UI.
	•	Backend Development
	•	Maintain the server environment for 
secure relay of encrypted messages.
	•	Ensure ephemeral storage works 
correctly: deleted content is permanently 
removed.
	•	Manage WebSocket connections, 
authentication, and end-to-end encryption 
protocols.
	•	Security & Encryption
	•	Implement and review client-side 
encryption for all messages, posts, and 
forms.
	•	Verify that metadata stripping and IP 
masking functions are robust.
	•	Conduct code audits to prevent 
vulnerabilities or accidental leaks.
	•	Testing & Debugging
	•	Stress-test features under realistic 
usage scenarios.
	•	Ensure deletion workflows fully purge 
content from memory.
	•	Collaborate with QA volunteers to 
replicate and fix issues.
	•	Optional Advanced Roles
	•	Explore ways to scale the platform 
safely while maintaining privacy-first 
principles.
	•	Integrate new secure features 
(live streaming, event coordination) 
only after core safety systems are verified.
	•	Contribute to the open-source security 
review process to maintain transparency.

Expectations for Coders/Developers:
	•	Uphold absolute security standards — 
no shortcuts, no data exposure.
	•	Maintain documentation and clarity 
so other volunteers can safely engage.
	•	Collaborate with project leads to 
prioritize features that ensure user safety 
and core functionality first.

is permanently removed from all systems.
	3.	Metadata & IP Masking — Uploaded 
media stripped of GPS/EXIF; IP addresses 
anonymized.
	4.	No Third-Party Integration — No ads, 
analytics, or corporate surveillance.
	5.	Transparency — Volunteers and users 
have access to security and policy 
documentation.


7. Tools and Workflow for Volunteers
	•	CryptPad (Self-Hosted):
Task coordination, secure communication,
and volunteer onboarding. All pads and 
channels are fully under VivaU control, 
end-to-end encrypted, and self-hosted. No 
third-party access.
	•	Development / Test Environment:
Safe testing of features, including 
community feed, mutual aid forms, and 
encrypted DMs, before public release.
	•	Documentation:
Step-by-step guides for mutual aid, 
testing, and coding tasks, ensuring 
volunteers understand workflows and 
safety protocols.
	•	Reporting:
Secure, centralized channels for bugs, 
security issues, or workflow suggestions. 
All communication happens inside 
Mattermost to maintain privacy.



8. Goals of Volunteering

By volunteering, you are:
	•	Protecting users from surveillance and 
exploitation.
	•	Helping build real-world community 
resilience.
