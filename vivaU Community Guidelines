Effective October 6, 2025 (Version 1.0)




vivaU exists for one purpose, to protect and 
empower people organizing, resisting, and 
surviving under systems of violence and 
control.
This platform was built for those who refuse 
to be silenced. These guidelines are here 
to protect the community, not to control it.



1. Respect Autonomy

Every person on vivaU has the right to 
speak, organize, and act freely.
Do not attempt to control, manipulate, or 
coerce others.
Freedom of expression is sacred, but it ends 
where it endangers someone’s safety.



2. No Oppression or Violence

This space will never be used to harm others.
No hate speech, fascist propaganda, 
harassment, threats, or targeted abuse.
vivaU is a refuge for the oppressed, not a 
weapon for the oppressors.



3. Privacy and Security First

Protect yourself. Protect others.
Do not expose personal data, names, or 
identifying details, even with good 
intentions.
Never share private information, locations,
or conversations without explicit consent.
Every action should prioritize safety from 
surveillance, retaliation, and state 
violence.



4. Truth and Accountability

This is a platform for truth, not 
misinformation.
Share facts responsibly, credit your 
sources, and correct mistakes when you can.
We do not silence discussion, but we demand 
integrity.




5. Mutual Aid and Collective Action

Support one another. Offer resources.
Organize and mobilize responsibly, never in 
ways that endanger others.
vivaU is about solidarity, not spectacle.
If you have more, give. If you need help, 
ask.



6. Violations and Enforcement

vivaU does not police expression, but we 
will act to prevent harm.
If someone threatens safety, spreads 
fascist rhetoric, or violates another’s 
privacy, their content may be removed or 
restricted to protect the community.
This is not punishment. It’s protection.



7. Our Commitment

We will never cooperate with corporate or 
state entities.
We will never sell or share your data.
We will always stand with the people and 
defend your right to exist, speak, and 
organize safely.
