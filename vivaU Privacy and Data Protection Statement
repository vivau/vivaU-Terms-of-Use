Effective October 6, 2025



vivaU will never sell, share, or store 
personal data.
No names. No locations. No message logs.
Every connection is encrypted, every 
message is protected, and every trace of 
identifying data is wiped the moment it’s 
no longer needed.

We do not collect metadata.
We do not track IPs.
We do not run analytics.
We do not cooperate with governments, 
corporations, or any entity that seeks 
to monitor or exploit people.

Our infrastructure is decentralized.
Our systems are built to resist 
surveillance, censorship, and infiltration.
Your privacy is not a feature, it is the 
foundation of vivaU.

We don’t answer to profit.
We don’t answer to power.
We answer only to the people we protect.

This is our pledge.
