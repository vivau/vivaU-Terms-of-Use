Effective Date: October 6, 2025
Version: 1.0




At vivaU, your safety, privacy, and freedom 
are non-negotiable.
We are building a platform where people 
can communicate, organize, and share 
without surveillance, tracking, or 
exploitation.
This policy explains exactly how we handle 
your information, and how we refuse to 
handle it.



1. Information We Collect 
    (and What We Don’t)

vivaU collects only what is absolutely 
necessary to function:
	•	Username and password (for account 
access)
	•	Optional profile information that you 
choose to share
	•	Content you post (text, photos, videos,
or media)

We do not collect or permanently store:
	•	IP addresses (beyond temporary routing, 
which is masked)
	•	Device, location, or browser data
	•	Any tracking identifiers or analytics 
data
	•	Information for advertising, profiling,
or monetization

vivaU does not monitor you, build profiles,
or sell data.



2. End-to-End Encryption

All private messages and direct 
communications on vivaU are end-to-end 
encrypted by default.
Only the sender and recipient can read 
them. Not vivaU, not your provider, not 
any government.
We cannot decrypt or access your 
conversations under any circumstance.



3. Metadata Stripping

Every upload (photos, videos, documents) is 
automatically scrubbed of GPS, EXIF, and 
device data before being stored or displayed.
This ensures no hidden location or identity 
data is ever exposed.



4. IP Masking

vivaU uses IP masking to shield your 
location and identity.
Your IP address is never stored in raw form.
This prevents tracking, mapping, or 
deanonymization of users by external 
entities or state surveillance systems.



5. No Third-Party Integration

We never connect with third-party APIs,
advertisers, or data processors.
There are:
	•	No cookies for ads or analytics
	•	No trackers
	•	No partnerships with corporations or 
state entities

vivaU is self-contained, 
community-controlled, and free from 
external interference.



6. Anonymous and Guest Access

You may access vivaU without creating an 
account.
Guest users can browse content, mutual aid 
pages, and verified organizers but cannot 
post, like, or comment.
This mode ensures total anonymity for users 
who need protection.



7. Content Ownership

You own everything you post.
By uploading to vivaU, you grant a limited,
non-exclusive license for your content to 
be displayed only within the platform.
We will never sell, redistribute, or reuse 
your work outside vivaU.



8. Data Rights and Portability

You have full control over your data at 
all times:
	•	You may export your content and 
account data on demand.
	•	You may delete your account permanently.
Once deleted, all your data is irreversibly 
erased from our systems.

vivaU does not archive or back up deleted 
information.



9. Security and Protection

vivaU was built to safeguard activists, 
journalists, organizers, and vulnerable 
communities.
Our security stack includes:
	•	End-to-end encryption for all messages
	•	IP and metadata masking
	•	No third-party dependencies
	•	Hardened infrastructure and continuous 
auditing
	•	Regular open-source security reviews

We deploy all updates manually to prevent 
injection of corporate or government code.



10. Retention and Data Lifecycle

Data is retained only as long as necessary 
to operate the service.
Deleted accounts and content are 
permanently purged from all systems.
There are no backups, mirrors, or shadow 
copies.



11. Transparency and Trust

vivaU stands for total transparency:
	•	We do not sell or share user 
data, ever.
	•	We do not cooperate with corporate or 
governmental surveillance requests.
	•	All privacy features are active by 
default.
	•	Users have full access to security and 
policy documentation.

Your privacy, safety, and freedom are not 
features. They are the foundation of this 
platform.
