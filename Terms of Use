These terms govern your use of vivaU,

connect people living under increasing 
surveillance and state oppression.

these shared principles of privacy, safety, 
and solidarity.

Effective: October 6, 2025
Version 1.0 — Public Release





1. Voluntary Participation

Using vivaU is completely voluntary. You 
choose how and when to engage.
No one is tracked, coerced, or profiled.
Your presence here is your choice, your 
voice, your power.



2. Account Responsibility

You are responsible for your account and 
any actions taken through it.
Keep your login secure and protect your 
access, not because we’re watching, but 
because we never will.
We cannot reset or view your passwords; 
your keys are yours alone.



3. Content Ownership and Control

You own everything you post.
Always.
By posting, you grant vivaU a non-exclusive 
right to display your content only within 
vivaU, nowhere else, ever.
We will never sell, share, or use your work 
beyond this community.

Your content is your voice. Your voice 
stays yours.



4. Prohibited Harm

Hate, harassment, or direct harm toward 
others has no place here.
vivaU exists to protect and empower people,
not to be used as a weapon against them.



5. Autonomy and Freedom

vivaU does not control your organizing, 
beliefs, or communication.
We are not a government, a corporation, or 
a hierarchy. We are a collective tool built 
by and for the people.
We enforce only what’s necessary to keep 
users safe from infiltration, harassment, 
or state surveillance.

You decide what you say, how you connect,
and how you move. vivaU simply gives you 
the shield to do it freely.





6. No Third-Party Interaction

vivaU never interacts with, shares data 
with, or receives funding from third 
parties, advertisers, or government 
entities.
No trackers. No analytics. No surveillance 
infrastructure.
No data leaves this space, ever.

Your communication stays encrypted, your 
data is not stored, and your identity 
remains masked. Even under pressure, we 
hold no information that can be used 
against you.



7. Adaptation for Safety

These terms may evolve as threats evolve.
We will update policies only to increase 
protection and reinforce safety.
We will never weaken security, open the 
door to outside control, or cooperate with 
any entity seeking to exploit or monitor 
users.

By continuing to use vivaU, you acknowledge 
that we will always choose user safety and 
privacy over convenience, profit, or 
compliance with unjust power.




Our Promise

vivaU exists because people deserve 
privacy, freedom, and a space to organize 
without fear.
We will protect that right relentlessly.
We will not compromise, cooperate, or 
comply with oppression.
Your safety is non-negotiable.
